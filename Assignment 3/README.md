# Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data-set given below.

_Download the dataset from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mV_ifvzzrlPWgdSzrwW5ZK-aF3S9tydZ/view?usp=sharing)_.

_The detailed description about the dataset can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14d4n90nryAUgA-IdNSXJAFzmynn6WTT4XfS7N4tum7s/edit?usp=sharing)_.

_Have a look at an [example EDA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kyNGZtexuRYwdud_LbYkLs018YYrKKv_?usp=sharing)_.

# Instructions / Help

If you are facing any difficulty in performing EDA, follow the steps mentioned below:

  1. *Introduction*:  Give a detailed data description and objective
  2. Import the data and display the head, shape and description of the data.
  3. *Univariate Analysis*: PDF, Histograms, Boxplots, Countplots, etc.
      - Find the outliers in each numerical column.
      - Understand the probability and frequency distribution of each numerical column.
      - Understand the frequency distribution of each categorical Variable/Column.
      - Mention observations after each plot.
  4. Bivariate Analysis
      - Discover the relationships between numerical columns using Scatter plots,  hexbin plots, pair plots, etc.
      - Identify the patterns between categorical and numerical columns using swarmplot, boxplot, barplot, etc.
      - Mention observations after each plot.
  5. Conclusion
  6. 
_NOTE: Mention observations after each plot._
    
 _(For the below mentioned step do your own research (use Google). Hints are given below.)_

  6. Perform feature transformation:
      - For Numerical Features -> Do Column Standardization
      - For Categorical -> if more than 2 categories, use dummy variables. Otherwise convert the feature to Binary.
